**Purpose:**  
* Get the pre-trained ResNet18 model and train it for CIFAR10 dataset
* Find 50 misclassified images from validation set
* For those misclassified images, check which features the model (considering a particular layer) was looking at by using GradCAM
  
**What this sub-repository contains:**  
The notebook of this project is uploaded in the same folder and "Misclass_images" folder is a gallery of 50 misclassified images along with their GradCAM heatmap illustrations.
